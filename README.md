There are basically two functions of this programs.

1. Encryption:  It can encrypt any text file. When this option is selected then user will be asked to enter the input text file. Then user will be asked to enter a password to protect the file. Then user will also have to give a name of the output file.
                The program will encrypt the input file into 0's and 1's. Output file will be saved to the pre determined location.
                
                Note:  Input file will be kept as it is.
       
       
2.  Decryption:  The encrypted file can be decryptd using this option. User will be asked to enter the encrypted file name. Then user have to enter the correct password and output file name. The program will decrypt the file to its original form.
         
         Note:  If either the password is wrong or the encrypted file is corrupted then this program can't decrypt the file anymore. In that case the output file will be useless file.
